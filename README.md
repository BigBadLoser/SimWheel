# SimWheel

Source files for my Ferrari SF90 F1 wheel. Uses a PGA2350 as the main processor, 
also uses an Adafruit USB hub of some sort, allows one cable for output even with the VoCore usb screen installed :)

###TODO:
- Fix HAT switch wiring.
- Move upper led_din to a GPIO pin that supports PIO (oops)
- add connectors for the rear 2 push buttons that i forgot
